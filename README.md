# Cuisine Prediction using Python

Over the years, people have tried to explore new ingredients and incorporate them into recipes or
produce new recipes all together. One of the obvious relations that we would like to explore is
the relationship between ingredients and cuisines. We use the Yummly data-set to study the
problem of predicting the cuisine of a recipe based on its ingredients. On testing several
classifiers we observed that SVM works best for this prediction task.
